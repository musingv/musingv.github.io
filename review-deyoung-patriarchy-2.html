<p>Greetings. Today I’m continuing my series reflecting on Kevin’s DeYoung’s article “<a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/death-to-the-patriarchy">Death To the Patriarchy?</a>” Last time, I laid out what I thought he was trying to accomplish. This time, I want to look at the argumentation Kevin offers to help readers see:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patriarchy fits with the way the world is.</li>
<li>Patriarchy fits with the way God made men and women.</li>
<li>Patriarchy aligns with the best Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics.</li>
<li>The essential nature of patriarchy for complementarians.</li>
</ol>
<p>Or in Kevin’s own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>careful exegesis is absolutely critical. But we need more than the right conclusions. We need to help people see that our exegetical conclusions do not just fit with the best hermeneutical principles; they fit with the way the world is and the way God made men and women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biblical vision of complementarity cannot be true without something like patriarchy also being true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this article, I want to look at the foundations that Kevin lays and then the argumentation that Kevin offers to reach his conclusions.</p>
<h1 id="interlude">Interlude</h1>
<p>As an aside, I want to acknowledge upfront that I found summarizing Kevin’s approach charitably incredibly difficult.  There are three main reasons for this, I believe:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a “mile wide, inch deep” nature to Kevin’s points. There are a lot of disconnected claims, but there’s not a tightly-woven argument. Many concise summaries of that end up sounding thoughtlessly dismissive (e.g. “Kevin makes a lot of claims such as A, B, and C that, even if accepted, don’t do more than vaguely suggest the plausibility of his conclusion”).</li>
<li>
<p>Kevin’s point is unclear. One quick example is when he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God created the world with sexual differentiation at the heart of what it means to be human beings made in his image. We cannot understand the created order as we should until we understand that God made us male and female.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does he mean by <em>heart</em>? Are eunuchs less human, for example, by nature of being eunuchs? Is Jesus less able to understand or mediate for women because he came in the flesh as a man? What does the term <em>created order</em> mean? In what ways can it not be understood without grasping sexual differentiation? Are we talking about understanding astronomy, physics, chemistry, or biology? Or is created order code for something like “God created the world with a hierarchy of authority: God over men over women?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The audience is never well established. If the article was aimed a a particular group, maybe this approach would make more sense. But as far as I can tell from Kevin’s writing, he is aiming to help Christians see more clearly. So I ought to be squarely in his target audience, especially with my more conservative background and leanings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And as always, the comments are a place to help me refine my thinking – feel free to jump in if you think I’m being uncharitable to Kevin.</p>
<h1 id="the-foundation">The Foundation</h1>
<p>So what is the foundational rationale that Kevin makes for his position? Here’s my best synopsis.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patriarchy, at its core, is about father rule, not domination or exploitation.</li>
<li>Patriarchy has unfairly been given a bad rap by biased feminists.</li>
<li>Old Europe<sup id="fnref:old"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:old">2</a></sup> (under patriarchy) wasn’t a bad place for women or children. In fact, maybe they were happier.</li>
<li>Subordination and role distinctions are not, in and of themselves, evidence of exploitation<sup id="fnref:exploit"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:exploit">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Sexual differentiation is at the heart of humans being made in the image of God.</li>
<li>A woman is a suitable helper for man (only) because she can bear children.</li>
<li>Men and women are different, particularly from birth.</li>
<li>Patriarchy has always existed and is inevitable; there never have been matriarchies.</li>
<li>Patriarchy is about all of society, not just narrow venues such as church and home.</li>
<li>The absence of patriarchy leads to anarchy.</li>
<li>Men are connected to authority and leadership; women are connected to the creation of life.</li>
<li>Patriarchy is primarily about the self-subjugation of men.</li>
<li>Women are intended to be refuges for men in the home.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="reaction">Reaction</h1>
<p>Yikes! I’d bet good money that some (many? all?) of those points come across as incredibly offensive to many readers. I want to circle back to particular points in more depth, but first I want to make four replies about the overall approach.</p>
<h2 id="the-intended-audience">The Intended Audience</h2>
<p>First, who is the intended audience of this article? Rather than imagining my preferred audience (e.g. any American reader), what clues do we have?</p>
<ol>
<li>Kevin talks about “those who want to recapture a lost vision of sexual differentiation and order.” So perhaps he is writing those who already believe in patriarchy.</li>
<li>Later, Kevin talks about helping church members, especially younger ones, understand the broader context of complimentarianism.</li>
<li>Kevin uses the word “we” in his writing (e.g. “We should be careful not to banish patriarchy…” or “We need to help church members”.) Some of those “we” statements seem more inclusive than, say, staunch patriarchists. For example, “The creation story is so familiar to most of us that we overlook the obvious.” When he writes “we don’t see in the same way is how to interpret these phenomena” (as either innate differences or centuries of oppression), the we seems incredibly divide, including even those who believe men and women are the same (e.g. radical femminists).</li>
<li>
<p>The article is published on Desiring God - where <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/about-us">they say</a> this about their resources</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everything we create and distribute here at Desiring God exists to guide you toward everlasting joy in Jesus Christ.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The article is posted online in English.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Desiring God, then, this resource is for me (and any my readers who click through to see the original article, and any egalitarians, feminists, radicalists, or others who might come across the article as well). Implicitly according to Kevin, this article seems intended to help church members (including, no doubt, a significant number that might not be Christian). And perhaps it is intended to reach a broader audience (e.g. egalitarians or feminists). At a minimum, he is likely aware that his article will be broadly accessible across English-speaking people, especially Western audiences, and particularly American ones.</p>
<p>As a self-identified reformed evangelical Christian, I expect that Kevin wants to accomplish at least one goal: Drawing as many people to an accurate portrayal of Jesus as possible. As part of that, I expect he wants to open his opponents up to considering his perspective. For example, by understanding their objections or at least showing an attempt to and an openness to understanding better.</p>
<p>That expectation comes from my own goals in writing. I expect a lot of people who read my writing will disagree with me – people who I don’t understand and for whom I seem unreasonable and perhaps a bit crazy. But one of my hopes is that my approach will persuade them that (a) I do want the best for them, however misguided I may be, (b) I want to dialog and understand, and (c) maybe there’s some method to my madness.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Exemplar of Gracious, Thoughtful Engagement</p>
<p>I found Gregory Thempson and Duke Kwon’s <a href="https://thefrontporch.org/2021/07/sanctifying-the-status-quo-a-response-to-reverend-kevin-deyoung/">defense of reparations</a> a masterclass in this kind of writing. I went into their response uncertain yet anticipating something incomprehensibly liberal. However, their gracious, thoughtful, and well-argued response led me to reconsider my views (and eventually to shift them significantly) while giving me new categories of how to think about white evangelical culture.</p>
</div>
<p>Kevin’s response persuades me of none of the above. I don’t think he understands my concerns, let alone those who more radically disagree with him. The scattershot approach might be possible as an introductory article to a longer series, but I’m stunned and taken aback if we think this is the kind of thoughtful dialog that will persuade others while modeling loving Jesus with all our mind.</p>
<h2 id="does-it-matter">Does It Matter?</h2>
<p>In all fairness, one might ask “Why bother taking Kevin’s article seriously? Why not just dismiss it?”</p>
<p>First, there’s the issue that Desiring God chose to publish this article (in all fairness, Kevin’s take isn’t out of line with many of Piper’s previous posts on these topics), and Piper along with Desiring God are broadly referenced in conservative theological circles.</p>
<p>Secondly, the perspectives within the evangelical world seem to fall into two groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Egalitarians.</li>
<li>Complimentarians, ranging from a very soft complementarianism all the way to patriarchists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within those groups, the complementarian camp appears completely unwilling to divide from – or even critique – any version of complementarianism. That is, it is better to be a complimentarian, no matter how little one protects women, than it is to be an egalitarian, no matter how well one protects women from harm.</p>
<p>And my take – perhaps mistaken – is that Kevin writes with the implicit support of a large amount of the conservative evangelical world. <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/profile/kevin-deyoung/">Kevin</a> himself sits on the The Gospel Coalition council and is an associate professor at Reformed Theological Seminary. <a href="https://cbmw.org/about/council/">Members of the CBMW council</a> such as John Piper, Joe Rigney, and Wayne Grudem frequently <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/authors">write for Desiring God</a>. In contrast, I’m not aware of any non-egalitiarian pushback against patriarchy or advocating for the defense of women from these circles.</p>
<p>In other words, my perception is that a large portion of the evangelical world either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agrees with Kevin.</li>
<li>Sees Kevin’s views as too minor to engage (e.g. they are harmless or insignificant)</li>
<li>Believes a greater good is achieved by not engaging (e.g. not criticizing other Christians, the glory of Jesus, the spread of the gospel)</li>
<li>Cares more about power and position than genuinely caring for people or pursing the truth.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the risk of belaboring the obvious, here are my counter-arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Highly problematic for all the reasons I discuss in this series, especially since it implies so much agreement with him that it isn’t worth presenting a better, clearer, or more winsome rationale.</li>
<li>Almost implicitly self-defeating given that Kevin is being published on Desiring God, the tone and stridency that many (such as the CBMW) take on such matters, the significance that Kevin claims for his ideas, and the vast number of stories women tell about how they are treated.</li>
<li>Terrifying as it implies following Jesus is well-paired with a collective silence about the dignity and wellbeing of, well, about half God’s image bearers.</li>
<li>Sufficiently un-Christlike that I won’t comment further at this point.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be explicit:</p>
<p><strong>Yes, it matters how we treat women</strong>. And if our beliefs determine how we act, then what we believe about men and women deeply matters. And if so much of the purportedly Christian world is comfortable promoting these kinds of ideas or being silent about them, then they absolutely should be addressed more.</p>
<p>Beyond that, how we reason through ideas and engage with our opponents models our faith – or at least a significant portion of it – to a watching world along with fellow Christians. When we evangelical Christians say we want to love God with all our minds, when we say they we want to make disciples of all nations, when we say we want to care well for the downtrodden, shouldn’t how we think about these matters reflect that?</p>
<p>(As an aside, this article has me thinking I may owe some of my egalitarian sisters an apology. I’ve generally assumed that they are overly fearful of a relatively small subset of Christians; that while they’ve had some bad experiences, they’ve been jumping at shadows and seeing a patriarchist under every rock. This article makes me ponder if perhaps they are far more accurate in their judgement than I have been.)</p>
<p>Of course, I’m just a musing villein. Perhaps I’m just ignorant of the finer points of thought, reasoning, and theology. So as always, respectful feedback in the comment section is appreciated. Next time I’ll give my other three big reactions.</p>
