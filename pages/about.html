            <p>Welcome to a musing villein pondering troth.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-villein">What is a villein?</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=villein">villein</a> is a medieval English peasant/serf<sup id="fnref:barr"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:barr">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-the-villein-moniker">Why use the villein moniker?</h3>
<p>First, because it matches my expertise. I&rsquo;m not a theologian fluent in the finer points of Greek or Hebrew. I&rsquo;m not a historian intimately familiar with church history or the nuances of textual transmission. I&rsquo;m not a therapist who has studied the human condition for years. I&rsquo;m not a biologist or geologist who can evaluate the scholarship behind macro-evolution or dating mechanisms of rocks.</p>
<p>Secondly, because those who seriously rock the boat on accepted conventions tend to quickly become unpopular &ndash; villains if you will. And one of my takeaways from the last few years is that the sort of writing I do will rock a lot of boats.</p>
<h3 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h3>
<p>Me? I am a random voice on the internet trying to make sense of the world around me. I write about what interests me and what I think really matters. I grew up in a fairly conservative home with a number of ties to the Southern Baptist Convention, although I think my family mostly attended non-SBC churches when I was a child. A crisis of faith in my teenage years led to my spending much of college figuring out what I believed, landing in a non-denominational style church<sup id="fnref:church"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:church">2</a></sup>. A series of scandals and decisions in the evangelical world led to me re-examining my faith again, especially the practice of it. A number of institutions and acclaimed individuals that significantly influenced me got caught up in wrongdoing &ndash; and in many cases, the structures that were intended to create accountability instead seemed negligent or complicit. On top of that, the evangelical world seemed to lose its mind by wholeheartedly endorsing Trump &ndash; and few people in my circles wanted to talk about why so many respected figures made this choice.</p>
<p>In many ways, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve changed much over the years. I still follow Jesus. I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m still spiritually conservative, but when I read breakdowns such as <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/six-way-fracturing-evangelicalism/">The Six Way Fracturing of Evangelicalism</a>, I&rsquo;m clearly far closer to, say, the Neo-Evangelicals (3s) than the Neo-Fundamentalist Evangelicals (1s).</p>
<p>A few inspirations in my reflections:</p>
<ol>
<li>In college, my political science professor talked about two ways of broadening one&rsquo;s horizons: Travel and reading. And the advantage of reading was that one could travel to cultures across time. If that professor was teaching today, I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;d include more modern forms of publishing such as YouTube, Twitter, and the like.</li>
<li>Also in college, I read a pair of essays by J. Budziszewski &ndash; <em><a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/1996/04/the-problem-with-conservatism">The Problem With Conservatism</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/1996/03/the-problem-with-liberalism">The Problem With Liberalism</a></em> that foundationally shaped my thinking about politics. I&rsquo;m not sure he said anything original (although it was the first time I&rsquo;d seen it), but he distinctly separated Jesus from conservatism and liberalism for me.</li>
<li>For years, I read <a href="http://www.drurywriting.com/keith/">Keith Drury&rsquo;s Tuesday column</a> where he wrote thoughtfully about Jesus and the Christian faith. In many ways, I hope my writing replicates for others what his column did for me. I don&rsquo;t know how often I agreed with him, but I found myself enriched from his columns.</li>
<li>About ten years ago, <a href="https://wthrockmorton.com/">Warren Throckmorton&rsquo;s writings</a> about Gospel for Asia introduced me to a darker side of the evangelical world and started me thinking about institutional power and structures &ndash; and what it meant to faithfully follow Jesus in that world.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-do-you-write">Why do you write?</h3>
<p>Four reasons. Well, maybe five.</p>
<ol>
<li>No one else is. Or at least, not enough people. And the bar for having a qualified opinion on the internet seems low enough that I seem unlikely to lower it.</li>
<li>I want to pass on a thoughtful faith to my children. I&rsquo;m concerned that too much of Christian writing today revolves around convenient myths rather than encouraging deep wrestling with the complexities of the world and what it means to love God with all our minds.</li>
<li>Maybe &ndash; just maybe &ndash; it will make a difference for others like myself who are confused or questioning.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning">Steelmanning</a> my ideas. As the saying goes, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. Publicly writing is a great way to get feedback and refine my ideas<sup id="fnref:idea"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:idea">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Greatness! Internet fame. Book deals. Talk shows. Celebrity status. This is the dark side of building a following &ndash; the temptation to sell out, to seek one&rsquo;s own power/fame/wealth over truth and justice. I&rsquo;m not immune to the desire. And it&rsquo;s probably the biggest reason I hesitate to write.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-do-you-write-anonymously">Why do you write anonymously?</h3>
<p>Fear, mostly. My employer won&rsquo;t let me go for saying something unpopular. An internet mob won&rsquo;t threaten to cancel me or try to get me fired. I can write without thinking &ldquo;What will my friends or acquaintances or pastor say if they read this?&rdquo; Some issues (e.g. mental health struggles) are just easier to discuss anonymously with strangers. And if I make a complete idiot of myself, I can just burn it all down and walk away<sup id="fnref:walk"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:walk">4</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:barr">
<p>Don&rsquo;t quote me to the medieval historians; I&rsquo;m sure there is all sorts of precise terminology and cultural context that I&rsquo;m completely misrepresenting here.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:barr" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:church">
<p>In many ways, these churches are very similar in their beliefs, practices, and culture. I&rsquo;m sure there were differences, but looking back, I&rsquo;m more struck by how similar they are.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:church" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:idea">
<p>I eventually aspire to collect my ideas in a book, so why not sharpen them now against lots of different perspectives?&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:idea" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:walk">
<p>On second thought, so many evangelical pastors step right back into senior positions in public ministry only a few months after disqualifying sin. So maybe the chance that I actually say or do something so personally destructive is a lot lower than I think. But I&rsquo;d like to think it&rsquo;d at least be hard for me to show my face if I wrote something really, really stupid.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:walk" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
