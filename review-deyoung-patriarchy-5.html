<p>Today I’m wrapping up my series reflecting on Kevin’s DeYoung’s article “<a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/death-to-the-patriarchy">Death To the Patriarchy?</a>”. I’m adding a few more scattered takeaways and then a wrap-up.</p>
<h1 id="the-subjugation-of-men-and-women">The Subjugation of Men (and Women)</h1>
<p>I’ve touched previously on the poor argumentation throughout the article. There’s one more place, though, where I want to highlight a huge problem. Kevin argues that patriarchy is primarily about male self-control, not about control over women:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s because patriarchy, rightly conceived, is not about the subjugation of women as much as it is about the subjugation of the male aggression and male irresponsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the sake of argument, I shall ignore how strange it is that so much ink would be spilled promoting the authority of men over women for a system that is primarily about the control of male aggression and irresponsibility. Further, let us briefly suppose that Kevin is right here about the primary purpose of patriarchy. Here are a few follow-up questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If women just happen to be routinely harmed in the process of subjugating male aggression and irresponsibility, what then? That’s just too bad?</li>
<li>If a system was routinely giving power to irresponsible and overly aggressive men, what then would be the responsibility of Christians (especially patriarchal ones) to protect their sisters in Christ? How might those responsibilities practically manifest in 21st century America?</li>
<li>How would a properly patriarchal society ensure that only the self-controlled and appropriately aggressive men are given power? How would we recognize whether we lived in a society that gave power to these self-controlled men as opposed to other men?</li>
<li>How would we expect women to react when they were subjugated by an irresponsible and overly aggressive man?</li>
</ol>
<p>When a primary criticism of patriarchy is the harm it does to women, how is the situation made any better by the subjugation of women being a secondary effect? Do the Biblical <em>one another</em> commands apply less if the violation is a side-effect? “Well, officer, the rapid deceleration at the bottom of the cliff was only a side-effect of my pushing Joe off of solid ground, so it’s actually fine, right? What is a little pushing between friends?” Yes, sometimes ignorance is an excuse. But only for so long. How long should I expect a defense of the patriarchy to miss such an obvious point?</p>
<h1 id="with-friends-like-these">With Friends Like These…</h1>
<p>…who needs enemies? Kevin writes that men “feel the urge to protect women and children.” Further more, he seems to view this stance as an obvious and foundational truth that should shape power structures.</p>
<p>Um, okay. First question: Is this urge reliably effective? If so, how do we explain the many, many cases throughout history where women and children have not been protected? Given that men have been in charge for most of history and there are an awful lot of atrocities where women and children are not protected, I’m not sure claiming that men have this urge particularly helps an argument for patriarchy. “Men should be in charge so they can protect you, just like they have in the past” seems more like a terrifying threat, not a persuasive argument. Even King David feared falling into the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+24%3A13-14">hands of men</a>.</p>
<p>As a modern day example, many women are regularly harassed in vulgar and vile terms on the internet. Some of what women like <a href="https://twitter.com/bethallisonbarr">Beth Barr</a>, <a href="https://aimeebyrd.com/">Aimee Byrd</a>, and <a href="https://sheilawraygregoire.com/">Sheila Gregoire</a> have shared about what they’ve endured from complementarian “Christians” is appalling. And I certainly haven’t seen Kevin DeYoung, Desiring God, the CBMW, or other vocal complementarians leaping loudly to their defense.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d love to see Kevin point to the writings or work he believes serve as good models for protecting women and children in churches. I’m well aware of his advocacy for complementarian/patriarchal positions. But I’m not aware that he’s written much about how to protect and heal the victims of abuse – or how to prevent such abuse in the first place. I’m aware he defended <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/why-we-have-been-silent-about-the-sgm-lawsuit/">CJ Mahaney</a>; I’m not aware he has ever reconsidered the substance or tone of that stance. Given Kevin’s strong advocacy for something like patriarchy, I would very much like to see Kevin explore what safe practice would look like, particularly with examples and witnesses from real life. After all, the claim here is that some churches are already living this approach out successfully, right?</p>
<h1 id="jesus-or-queen-victoria">Jesus or Queen Victoria?</h1>
<p>Kevin suggests women have civilizing influence on men in every society, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>they [men] look to women for gentleness, kindness, and love, for refuge from a world of pain and force, for safety from their own excesses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good friend tells me this idea is the <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/thackeray/angel.html">Angel in the House</a> trope, and feminists have made many responses to it over the years. I’m not familiar with either, but if so, doesn’t this idea need more support as to why it is more than a Victorian ideal? After all, as <em>sola scriptura</em> reformers, both Kevin and I are in pursuit of biblical truth, not 19th century values.</p>
<p>I do, though, have some theological questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Kevin is talking about non-Christian men and women here as well as Christian ones, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If part of the fruit of the spirit is love, kindness, and gentleness, should we not expect righteous men to exhibit the same sort of love, kindness, and gentleness as women?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Paul excluding women when he writes the following?</p>
<p>“God gave them over to a depraved mind…they have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%253A28-31">Romans 1:28-31</a></p>
<p>As a villein, I am doubtless missing the finer points of Greek, but “love, kindness, and gentleness” seems pretty far off course from Paul’s gist…right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Paul isn’t excluding women from his assessment, then can it really be true that men look to women for a godly gentleness, kindness, and love in every culture?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="unsustainable-obedience">Unsustainable Obedience?</h1>
<p>Underpinning Kevin’s whole argument is an idea that a narrow complementarianism, focused around submission in the home and a male pastorate, isn’t sustainable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my great concerns…is that complementarianism, for many Christians, amounts to little more than a couple of narrow conclusions about wives submitting to husbands in the home and ordination in the church being reserved for men. If that’s all we have in our vision for men and women, it’s not a vision we will hold on to for long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand this line of thought without more exposition. Why won’t Christians hold onto that vision for long? A basic argument in favor of sustainability could be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Christians are a people who pursue obedience to God – and make disciples who pursue obedience to God.</li>
<li>God commands men to lead in the homes as well as a male pastorate.</li>
<li>The textual exegesis of (2) is solid (i.e. egalitarians are clearly wrong).</li>
<li>Ergo, Christians can sustain this vision because we obey God and pass that obedience on to others.</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) and (3) are certainly disputed by egalitarians, but I don’t expect much hostility from the complementarian side. (1) is certainly a mess from many perspectives, but if Christians can’t do (1), they have a lot bigger problems than just the sustainability of complementarian thought; the whole Christian life, witness, and propagation of the faith comes into doubt. So (1) better be getting sorted out one way or the other.</p>
<p>I agree that it’s nice when God gives explanations of why he commands what he does, but surely that is not necessary for Christian obedience? From what I know of the reformed tradition, it seems to heavily emphasize obedience first – often with uncertainties, doubts, or misgivings being attributed to faithlessness, rebellion, or hardness of heart. I don’t recall ever seeing a reformed argument advocating for delaying obedience until God’s command made sense.</p>
<p>So why does Kevin believe a narrow complementarian vision is unsustainable?</p>
<h1 id="the-less-charitable-view">The Less Charitable View</h1>
<p>One idea I have – and I’m not sure if it is charitably trying to make sense of the article or uncharitably impugning Kevin’s motivations – is that there is a quiet, unwritten part anchoring Kevin’s argument that I’m supposed to “just know.” That is, if I just agreed with some fundamental premise (such as “Of course, men should rule. How else could the world function?”), then the rest of the argumentation would snap into place for me. I’m not sure if that’s the case, but if so, I wish Kevin would just say the quiet part out loud – it would make for a far stronger piece.</p>
<p>The other idea I have (and this is definitely the uncharitable view) is that many complementarians don’t want a robust, holistic, and considered application of theology to men and women. Instead, they want to maintain power. As such, for some the discussion is more about convincing as many people as possible – especially those who are relatively accepting of the authoritative men – not to question patriarchy, rather than to thoughtfully consider how to faithfully apply all of scripture.</p>
<h1 id="the-last-muse">The Last Muse</h1>
<p>Well, that was a long journey that I appreciate my readers taking with me (or perhaps undertaking a bit later if they’ve jumped to the end to see the TLDR). I’m left confused and baffled. My overall impression is that Kevin is advocating for the broadest definition of patriarchy that Barr offered – the one where society emphasizes male authority and female submission. I admit I’m reading into Kevin’s arguments there, but the references such as the ones to schools, anarchy, and all of life lead me to see this definition as the most plausible take on his thinking.</p>
<p>If Kevin or Desiring God is hiring a developmental editor, I’m available and I have excellent rates. I know how to post ideas to Twitter so that smart people of the internet can review early renditions and help me steelman the argumentation. I even follow a <a href="https://twitter.com/bethallisonbarr">medieval historian</a> who might be willing to give a bit of her expert feedback if respectfully engaged.</p>
<p>Overall, my reaction is that if Kevin’s rationale is representative of complementarian thought, I clearly should become an egalitarian. Conveniently, Kevin seems to agree with this, since he views something as patriarchy as non-negotiable for maintaining a complementarian vision. As a point of comparison, I’d nudge readers toward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC">Mike Winger’s recent teachings</a> on the role of women. While I haven’t fully worked through all of them, I’ve found the initial ones to be the sort of nuanced consideration I’d expect from thoughtful engagement with the Bible, gender roles, and modern society.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’m concerned that Desiring God chose to publish this article and what that says about their editorial process. Any author can have a bad take – as an aspiring writer, I expect to have more than my fair share of misses and faux pas. But for this article to successfully navigate editorial review at Desiring God leaves me wondering what they believe intellectual rigor, accessible argumentation, and loving God with all our minds looks like.</p>
<p>On the plus side:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a much better sense of what Kevin has in mind when he talks about exegetical conclusions – a perspective that seems to embrace male authority across life and history far beyond what I understood the best hermeneutical principles to support.</li>
<li>I have some great questions when I run across people advocating for the CBMW or similar perspectives, such as “What did you think of Kevin’s article?” and “Have you publicly provided your own perspective on the patriarchy?”</li>
<li>Kevin and I clearly have plenty to discuss if we should ever find ourselves eating lunch together.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, readers, that’s my take</p>
<h3 id="patriarchy-is-not-intrinsically-exploitative">Patriarchy Is Not Intrinsically Exploitative</h3>
<p>The argument: Sexual differentiation, subordination, and role distinctions are not, in and of themselves, evidence of exploitation.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>In a very strict conceptual sense, this appeal seems true. For example, a worker is subordinate[^alt] to his boss, but I wouldn’t assume the worker is exploited without more information. I’m not sure how this argument will be moved from concept to practice, though.</p>
</div>
<p>Always reforming, sola scriptura.</p>
<p># Absentee Fathers</p>
<p>Take 8: Absentee Patriarchs Ruin World</p>
<p>When Kevin says that “where patriarchy is already absent, dysfunction and desperation have multiplied,” I want specifics. North Korea seems pretty dysfunctional to me. Is it not patriarchal? The Trump movement – and its evangelical wing – seem exceptionally dysfunctional and desperate. Is patriarchy absent there? If you want to argue that the absence of patriarchy leads to more problems than its presence, I’d expect a fairly detailed argument, book citation, or at least an acknowledgement that supporting such an assertion is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Kevin wrote elsewhere in the article that “History is complex and rarely allows for meta-theories and monocausal explanations.” Isn’t blaming dysfunction and desperation on the absence of patriarchy a meta-theory with a monocausal explanation? Besides, I thought patriarchy was inevitable according to Kevin, so how can it be absent?</p>
<p>I’m sure Kevin has a more robust model in his head, but I don’t feel like he’s inviting me into it; instead, I feel like he pulls out whatever bit supports his current point with no context to help me understand how the new argument avoids colliding with his previous argumentation.</p>
