            <h2 id="reaction-1-get-writing-help">Reaction 1: Get Writing Help</h2>
<p>I consider myself pretty sympathetic to Kevin and where he wants to go. I&rsquo;m complementarian, I grew up in conservative Christian circles (complete with significant patriarchy), and I lean conservative on many topics (or at least conservative before conservative meant Team Trump). And yet I find Kevin&rsquo;s flow of thought hard to understand; in many places, I believe important arguments and deductions are just missing. Not missing in a &ldquo;I realize this will seem like a leap to many readers and I&rsquo;d love to unpack it somewhere else&rdquo; sense, but just missing as though there is no leap happening. And if I&rsquo;m struggling, I assume those to farther to the left will be far less inclined to take this piece seriously.</p>
<p>This leads me to the question: Who is Kevin writing for?</p>
<ul>
<li>Egalitarians, liberals, or left-leaning folk? I don&rsquo;t think so; I don&rsquo;t see Kevin&rsquo;s discourse causing them to thoughtfully engage with him.</li>
<li>Soft complementarians or those concerned with how women are treated? Again, I don&rsquo;t see his approach engaging with their concerns.</li>
<li>The complementarian base? Maybe, but even there, I&rsquo;m not clear how many complementarians will find themselves more strongly persuaded of their views because of this piece &ndash; at least not in a thoughtful way. It could be used an appeal to authority, but that doesn&rsquo;t align well with Kevin&rsquo;s stated purpose of helping people to see his perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s awkward. Who is left? Since this article was published at Desiring God, perhaps it is intended for their audience. Let&rsquo;s check out who Desiring God produces resources for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Everything we create and distribute here at Desiring God exists to guide you toward everlasting joy in Jesus Christ.&rdquo; https://www.desiringgod.org/about-us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So&hellip;the audience is you and me&hellip;and all the egalitarians and left-leaning folk who view the resource?</p>
<p>Well, okay, then. I guess this article is for me after all, and Desiring God would totally like to know whether this resource guides me (or you) toward everlasting joy in Jesus Christ. I&rsquo;m glad we cleared that up.</p>
<p>Let me offer two suggestions to Kevin and Desiring God that would really help this article be for everyone:</p>
<h3 id="suggestion-1-a-developmental-editor">Suggestion 1: A Developmental Editor</h3>
<p>Get an editor to help organize the flow of thought and refine the argumentation. If the goal is, as stated, to promote something like the patriarchy, there are better ways of structuring and presenting the argument. This role isn&rsquo;t about punctuation or grammar, it&rsquo;s about whether thoughts and ideas are cohesive, well-argued, and make sense.</p>
<p>For Desiring God, that editor needs to have control over what gets published. I don&rsquo;t know what their process is, but the fact that this article made it through suggests to me that they don&rsquo;t have developmental editors who can say &ldquo;This article isn&rsquo;t ready yet; it needs more work.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="suggestion-2-user-experience-testing">Suggestion 2: User Experience Testing</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a classic list of <a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html">&ldquo;Top 100 Things I&rsquo;d Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord&rdquo;</a>, and one of them is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That insight from others is one of the big advantages of user experience testing, especially from those who don&rsquo;t see eye-to-eye with you. While attempting to rehabilitate the patriarchy is sure to draw fire, surely steelmanning the argument based on initial reactions would go a long way to make people seriously consider the benefits of &ldquo;something like the patriarchy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="reaction-2-appreciation">Reaction 2: Appreciation</h2>
<p>I commend Kevin for having the insight to see that complementarianism struggles to answer the &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; when reduced to commands about men leading in the home and male pastors. I appreciate his choice to write on the topic, especially when not many do. I&rsquo;m glad he opposes all forms of domination, oppression, and exploitation. And in my own writings, I hope to emulate his boldness in laying out what must not be a very popular position. I wish far more Christians, especially pastors, would write so openly about what they believe.</p>
<h2 id="reaction-3-something-like-patriarchy-what">Reaction 3: &ldquo;Something&rdquo; Like Patriarchy? What?</h2>
<p>Kevin does a fantastic job of identifying much of the baggage associated with the patriarchy. He reviews different definitions, acknowledging that for many people, patriarchy is likely &ldquo;shorthand for all the ways our world promotes male supremacy and encourages female oppression.&rdquo; But he never redefines the term positively - unless his commentary on the strict definition (&ldquo;father rule&rdquo;) is intended to be his definition.</p>
<p>He ends his article saying &ldquo;something like patriarchy&rdquo; must be true for complementarianism to be true. But the phrase &ldquo;something like&rdquo; gives a lot of wiggle room.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/brockbahler/status/1552338014474575873">Twitter</a>, someone pointed out that <a href="https://twitter.com/bethallisonbarr">Beth Barr</a> defined patriarchy in her book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Biblical-Womanhood-Subjugation-Became/dp/1587434709">The Making of Biblical Womanhood</a></em> (pages 12-13), by summarizing Bennett&rsquo;s explanation of patriarchy into three main English meanings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Male ecclesiastical leaders&hellip;</li>
<li>Legal power of male household heads (fathers/husbands)</li>
<li>A society that promotes male authority and female submission</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>That definition seems pretty reasonable. It even avoids the loaded terms that Kevin expresses concern about &ndash; dominance, oppression, repression, inferiority, and subservience. But since Kevin doesn&rsquo;t actually say what he is advocating for, I&rsquo;m not sure if he agrees with the definition she and Bennett offer. Nor am I sure how much alteration the phrase &ldquo;something like&rdquo; is intended to express.</p>
<p>I find that lack of clarity to be a really big flaw in the article. It also makes charitably reviewing the article hard. One example: There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/should-women-be-police-officers">classic piece by Piper</a> that says all women should avoid all interactions with men that are both personal and directive. It&rsquo;s not that old (eight years), and it&rsquo;s also hosted on Desiring God. And it certainly fits into the third definition of patriarchy - a society that promotes male authority and female submission. But is that what Kevin is advocating for as a biblical vision? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<h1 id="reaction-4-the-problem-of-patriarchal-evil">Reaction 4: The Problem of (Patriarchal) Evil</h1>
<p>A classic objection to Christianity is the problem of evil: If God is all good and all powerful, then why does evil exist?</p>
<p>A similar objection exists when promoting the patriarchy or something like it. If patriarchy is so good, then what do we do with the evil that comes with it? I see five basic complementarian responses:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tactical denial</strong>: There really isn&rsquo;t a large scale abuse of power, so we don&rsquo;t need to worry about it. All of these stories of women (and men) being mistreated while the system protects their abusers are rare exceptions; overall, men are doing great with power.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical delay</strong>: The abuse matters and is a big deal, but it isn&rsquo;t the right time to tackle the problem; there are more pressing concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Moral imperative</strong>: We can&rsquo;t do better and still obey God. The evil is regrettable, but it&rsquo;s just the inevitable outcome of following God the way he wants to be followed.</li>
<li><strong>Moral justification</strong>: The abuse of power isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal. The important thing (e.g. the gospel, name of Jesus, whatever) is happening. Those mistreated by power should suck it up and appreciate their role in promoting the glory of God.</li>
<li><strong>Reform</strong>: Yes, what is happening is a great evil; how can such a thing happen among the people of God? We must repent and do better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of these is Kevin&rsquo;s answer? Or does he have another response? From his tone, I suspect his take isn&rsquo;t (2) or (5). The call to the past being better than we think it was, along with some of Kevin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/reparations-a-critical-theological-review/">other</a> <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/toward-a-better-discussion-about-abuse/">writings</a>, leads me to think his likely response is (1). He doesn&rsquo;t believe there is a large-scale institutional problem with men and power in the United States. And if he&rsquo;s right, it certainly strengthens his argument for patriarchy. Of course, that means there is a lot of evidence to explain, from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23131530/southern-baptist-convention-sexual-abuse-scandal-guidepost">Southern Baptist report</a> that barely scraped the surface of what&rsquo;s happened over the last forty years to Sheila&rsquo;s research on how women have been impacted by evangelical teachings to the abuse rates in Christian marriages to a number of high profile abuse scandals in churches and Christian institutions. And that&rsquo;s not even touching the voices such as <a href="https://jemartisby.com/">Jemar Tisby</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleJamesHoward">Kyle Howard</a> arguing that white evangelical America has a real problem with racism.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, Kevin explicitly disavows domination, exploitation, and oppression. But he never explores the relationship between patriarchy and such harms. I&rsquo;d love to see him react to the stories of different women who have been harmed, do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis">root cause analysis</a> on what led to those harms, and finally propose changes to avoid those harms in the future.</p>
<p>My sense is there is a disconnect here. Maybe it is he doesn&rsquo;t think patriarchy is the root issue. Maybe it&rsquo;s he doesn&rsquo;t think the harms should be categorized as domination, exploitation, or oppression. Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t think the harms are real, or that bad. I don&rsquo;t know. But something feels off between his disavowal of harms and his enthusiastic embrace of fathers ruling. Maybe the way we&rsquo;re handling power in the American evangelical circles is fine &ndash; but there seems to be a lot of evidence and voices saying we have a problem. And I&rsquo;m not clear how in good conscience I can ignore the testimony of so many (including many professing to be brothers and sisters who follow Jesus) and just chalk it up to all these objectors being completely blind and/or rebellious. Or perhaps all these voices are beyond the spirit of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A27">James&rsquo; command</a> to care for orphans and widows in their distress?</p>
<h1 id="reaction-5-the-far-past">Reaction 5: The Far Past</h1>
<p>Kevin argues that the far past, &ldquo;Old Europe,&rdquo; was a great place where children were loved, mothers were honored, and women were happier. I&rsquo;ll leave that for a medieval historian (maybe Beth Barr?) to tackle. Let&rsquo;s grant Kevin&rsquo;s argument for a moment &ndash; old Europe was fantastic. But I don&rsquo;t know much about that time and place &ndash; and I&rsquo;m not particularly persuaded we know enough to effectively model our family structures on theirs. Instead, I&rsquo;m rather familiar with 21st century American culture &ndash; and 20th century culture. Even 19th and 18th century American culture are far more familiar to me than old Europe. And I know enough about those periods to have some serious concerns. The whole escapade around kidnapping people from Africa and enslaving them and their descendants seems, um, at least slightly problematic. In the last hundred years, my state had redlining - intentional policy (and in some cases contract clauses) that limited where African Americans could live. Even the history behind child labor laws or the brutal resistance to unions suggests some pretty powerful resistance to protecting the helpless and poor. And the list goes on.</p>
<p>Insofar as Kevin wants to resurrect the power structures of Old Europe, I&rsquo;d love to hear more about it. But as far as those power structures reflect the American ones I&rsquo;m familiar with for the last few hundred years, I have a lot of questions.</p>
<h1 id="reaction-6-the-core-argument">Reaction 6: The Core Argument</h1>
<p>At its root, Kevin&rsquo;s argument seems to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Women were happy in the medieval ages.</li>
<li>Feminists view any power distinction as inherently bad.</li>
<li>Patriarchy has an excessively bad rap in today&rsquo;s culture.</li>
<li>There are gender differences.</li>
<li>Ergo, something like the patriarchy is a great good.</li>
<li>Furthermore, something like the patriarchy is essential to hold on to a Biblical complementarian perspective.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s unequivocally grant the first four arguments.</p>
<p>(As an aside, is (4) under much popular contention these days? More often than not, I see egalitarians arguing for women in power precisely because of these differences: Without their perspective, how is one going to lead the collective well? If there were no gender differences, then there&rsquo;s no particular benefit to the whole to including women. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some who deny any differences &ndash; and plenty of debate of what those differences are &ndash; but is there really that much debate about whether gender differences exist?)</p>
<p>Having granted all those premises, I&rsquo;m not seeing the leap to (5) and (6). It&rsquo;s one thing to say that patriarchy might not be a terrible evil, or might have some rationale behind it. It&rsquo;s another to wholeheartedly declare it a universal good. And I don&rsquo;t have a clue how Kevin expects me to be persuaded of his conclusions from his premises.</p>
<h1 id="reaction-7-baby-factory-thy-name-is-woman">Reaction 7: Baby Factory, Thy Name Is Woman</h1>
<p>If I&rsquo;m reading Kevin correctly, he says that women are good helpmates because &ndash; and only because &ndash; they can have babies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to God’s biological design, only Eve (not another Adam) was a suitable helper because only Eve (together with Adam) could obey the creation mandate. That’s why she was “a helper fit for him” (Genesis 2:18).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an interpretation of Genesis 2:18. I&rsquo;d love to see a link to a cohesive exegesis of that passage. I&rsquo;d also like to know if Kevin thinks his whole case lives or dies by that interpretation. It&rsquo;s one of the few Biblical justifications he gives. From my reading of the text, I&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to draw the same conclusion, certainly not in such an authoritative way. I&rsquo;m not sure I have a better understanding of why Eve was a suitable helper, but two lines of thought that I&rsquo;d like to pursue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Practically, there&rsquo;s something (or many somethings) in the design of male-female differences that make women better helpmates in marriage than men beyond simply the function of having children.</li>
<li>Somehow two different-yet-like persons becoming one reflects something about the oneness of God and the church.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wish a good editor had helped Kevin here; I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m misreading him as reducing a woman&rsquo;s distinctiveness as a marital helpmate down to &ldquo;she can have babies&rdquo; &ndash; but that&rsquo;s sure how he reads to me. It&rsquo;s particularly weird, too, given that he argues elsewhere in the article for the significant differences between men and women &ndash; yet a woman&rsquo;s helpmate suitability is determined by whether she can have children?</p>
<p>I expect this line of thinking to hit infertile women and others struggling with having children particularly hard. Because the implication is that, if one can&rsquo;t have children, one isn&rsquo;t a suitable helpmate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned by the implications for same-sex couples: If a same-sex couple can adopt children, is a man really as good a companion for a man as a woman? Kevin seems to confirm this point by writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God could have created a group of male companions to hang out in Adam’s man cave so that Adam wouldn’t be alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for following the Biblical text where it takes us, but Kevin&rsquo;s take here seems to unnecessarily cede an immense amount of ground to the same-sex marriage crowd that I expect he (and others) would like to defend.</p>
<h1 id="short-takes">Short Takes</h1>
<p>Alright, those are my major reactions to what Kevin has written. I have a number of smaller thoughts and questions that I&rsquo;m going to handle as quick takes.</p>
<h1 id="take-1-resistance-is-futile">Take 1: Resistance Is Futile&hellip;</h1>
<p>&hellip;and you will be assimilated. Technically, Kevin actually writes this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, patriarchy is inevitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case (and he&rsquo;s so sure of it), why write so many words in such a roundabout way on the topic? Wouldn&rsquo;t be more useful and effective to, say, pen a nice letter to the liberals appealing to them to accept reality for their own good?</p>
<h1 id="take-2-secret-egalitarian-promoter">Take 2: Secret Egalitarian Promoter?</h1>
<p>Kevin argues that almost everyone sees that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>men and women — taken as a whole — tend to form friendships differently, talk to their peers differently, and manifest different instincts related to children, sex, and career.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tend to agree. I also believe that most egalitarians would argue that is exactly why it matters whether or not women are represented in power. They have a different perspective, and the traditional view of patriarchy silences their voice. And their voice matters, not just to them as individuals, but for the good of the whole. I wish Kevin would lay out how his view of the patriarchy is different from the traditional one when it comes to excluding women&rsquo;s viewpoints.</p>
<h1 id="take-3-dichotomous-choices">Take 3: Dichotomous Choices</h1>
<p>From his dramatic prose, I gather that Kevin really wants me to see the world as a choice between extremes &ndash; a faithful Biblical patriarchy-or-something-like-it or godless modern egalitarian chaos. Gender differences in the home, religion, and the world are entirely caused by &ndash; and pick only one cause for all differences across all time and culture &ndash; innate gender differences or centuries of oppression and prejudice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not clear why my options are so extreme. I can be concerned about unbridled capitalism without being a communist or socialist. I can have my doubts about pure democracy without believing in dictators and monarchs. Can&rsquo;t I have deep concerns about systems that seem to give certain men vast amounts of power &ndash; largely checked by Twitter and public outrage &ndash; without promoting anarchy or abandoning Biblical principles? Can&rsquo;t I believe that men and women are different and also accept that men and their institutions often systematically dehumanize women in ways that treat them as less than precious children of God?</p>
<h1 id="take-4-man-beats-woman-gains-responsibility">Take 4: Man Beats Woman, Gains Responsibility?</h1>
<p>Kevin argues that patriarchy is primarily about self-control, not about control over women:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s because patriarchy, rightly conceived, is not about the subjugation of women as much as it is about the subjugation of the male aggression and male irresponsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it strange how much ink is spilled promoting the authority of men over women for a system that is primarily about the control of male aggression and irresponsibility, but let&rsquo;s ignore that for a moment and consider a few questions that emerge:</p>
<ol>
<li>So if women just happen to be routinely harmed in the process of subjugating male aggression and irresponsibility, that&rsquo;s just too bad? Or it isn&rsquo;t a proper patriarchy?</li>
<li>If a system was routinely giving power to irresponsible and overly aggressive men, would that then be a failed patriarchy? Or a non-patriarchal society?</li>
<li>How would a properly patriarchal society ensure that only the self-controlled and appropriately aggressive men are given power? How would we recognize whether we lived in a society that gave power to these self-controlled men as opposed to other men?</li>
<li>How would we expect women to react when they were subjugated by an irresponsible and overly aggressive man?</li>
</ol>
<p>When a primary concern with patriarchy is the harm done to women, how does the subjugation of women being a secondary effect make it any better? Do the one another commands apply less if the violation is a side-effect? &ldquo;Well, officer, the rapid deceleration at the bottom of the cliff was a side-effect of my pushing Joe off of solid ground, so it&rsquo;s actually fine, right? What is a little pushing between friends?&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="take-5-obvious-takes">Take 5: Obvious Takes</h1>
<p>At the risk of deviating from the intended script, what response is Kevin expecting when he asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What school or church or city center or rural hamlet is better off when fathers no longer rule?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a complicated question that seems like it would depend on a number of factors.</p>
<ol>
<li>How is Kevin defining <em>better off</em>? And the term <em>rule</em>?</li>
<li>Is Kevin suggesting that any father is better running any institution than any women? That seems like a huge stretch without more justification.</li>
<li>Is Kevin suggesting that patriarchy applies to every institution? If not, which ones does he have in mind? The reference to schools and city centers suggests to me a very expansive view of the male authority, along the lines of the third definition of patriarchy that Barr provided earlier.</li>
<li>Does he mean &ldquo;fathers and only fathers rule&rdquo; or does he mean &ldquo;wise men and women rule together&rdquo;? I&rsquo;m guessing the former, but maybe he&rsquo;s really concerned about the possibility that fathers are completely excluded from leadership? If the latter, I agree that women-only rule could create a lot of problems.</li>
<li>Is Kevin suggesting that churches should only have pastors who are fathers &ndash; no more single or childless pastors? That&rsquo;s actually an interesting concept to explore, but I suspect that&rsquo;s not at all what Kevin means to promote.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what examples Kevin has in mind here or how he expects me to evaluate those examples, but here&rsquo;s what comes to mind for me. I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone can point to institutions that are better off without specific fathers (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Zacharias">Ravi Zacharias</a> from Ravi Zacharias International Ministries). I&rsquo;ve certainly known some women who are terrible leaders in certain positions. I&rsquo;ve known mediocre schools where women were principals &ndash; and some mediocre schools where men were principals. I&rsquo;ve seen, say, the Michigan State University response to Larry Nassar &ndash; which I&rsquo;d categorize as primarily led by men &ndash; and been exceptionally unimpressed. I&rsquo;ve generally been impressed by <a href="https://rachaeldenhollander.com/">Rachel Denhollander&rsquo;s</a> advocacy. Do I think Michigan State would be better off if she&rsquo;d controlled their response? Yes, I do.</p>
<p>From his rhetoric, that&rsquo;s almost certainly not the answer Kevin expects me to have, but I don&rsquo;t think my answer is that different than most people who have thoughtfully observed institutional leadership for any length of time.</p>
<h1 id="take-6-with-protection-like-this">Take 6: With Protection Like This&hellip;</h1>
<p>Kevin writes that men &ldquo;feel the urge to protect women and children&rdquo; and seems to view this as an obvious and foundational truth that should shape power structures.</p>
<p>Um, okay. First question: Is this urge effective and powerful? If so, how do we explain the many, many cases throughout history where women and children have not been protected? Given that men have been in charge for most of history and there are an awful lot of atrocities where women and children are not protected, I&rsquo;m not sure claiming that men have this urge particularly helps an argument for patriarchy. &ldquo;Men should be in charge so they can protect you, just like they have in the past&rdquo; seems more likely to be a terrifying threat, not a persuasive argument. As a modern day example, many women are regularly harassed in vulgar and vile terms on the internet. Some of what women like Beth Barr and <a href="https://aimeebyrd.com/">Aimee Byrd</a> have shared about what they&rsquo;ve endured from complementarian &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; is appalling. And I certainly haven&rsquo;t seen the CBMW or Desiring God or other complementarian pastors or advocates effectively coming to their aid.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d love to see Kevin point to the writings or work he believes serve as good models for protecting women and children in churches. I&rsquo;m well aware of his advocacy for complementarian/patriarchal positions. But I&rsquo;m not aware that he&rsquo;s written much about how to protect and heal the victims of abuse &ndash; or how to prevent such abuse in the first place. I&rsquo;m aware he defended <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/why-we-have-been-silent-about-the-sgm-lawsuit/">CJ Mahaney</a>; I&rsquo;m not aware he has ever reconsidered the substance or tone of that stance. Given Kevin&rsquo;s strong advocacy for something like patriarchy, I would very much like to see Kevin explore what safe practice would look like, particularly with examples and witnesses from real life. After all, the claim here is that some churches are already living this approach out successfully, right?</p>
<h1 id="take-7-jesus-or-victoria">Take 7: Jesus or Victoria?</h1>
<p>Kevin seems to spiritualize women:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in every society, Goldberg writes, &ldquo;they [men] look to women for gentleness, kindness, and love, for refuge from a world of pain and force, for safety from their own excesses”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good friend tells me this idea is the <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/thackeray/angel.html">Angel in the House</a> trope, and feminists have many responses to it. I&rsquo;m not familiar with the trope or the responses, but if that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;d hope that Kevin would acknowledge that and provide a bit more counterpoint as to why this idea is more than a Victorian image. After all, as sola scriptura reformers, both Kevin and I are in pursuit of biblical truth, not 19th century values.</p>
<p>I do, though, have some theological questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kevin is talking about non-Christian men and women here as well as Christian ones, right?</li>
<li>If part of the fruit of the spirit is love, kindness, and gentleness, should we not expect righteous fathers to exhibit the same sort of love, kindness, and gentleness as women?</li>
<li>
<p>Is Paul excluding women when he writes the following?</p>
<p>&ldquo;God gave them over to a depraved mind&hellip;they have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%253A28-31">Romans 1:28-31</a></p>
<p>As a villein, I may be missing the finer points of Greek, but &ldquo;love, kindness, and gentleness&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really seem to match Paul&rsquo;s gist&hellip;right?
4. If Paul isn&rsquo;t excluding women from his assessment, then can it really be true that men look to women for a godly gentleness, kindness, and love in every culture?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="take-8-absentee-patriarchs-ruin-world">Take 8: Absentee Patriarchs Ruin World</h1>
<p>When Kevin says that &ldquo;where patriarchy is already absent, dysfunction and desperation have multiplied,&rdquo; I want specifics. North Korea seems pretty dysfunctional to me. Is it not patriarchal? The Trump movement &ndash; and its evangelical wing &ndash; seem exceptionally dysfunctional and desperate. Is patriarchy absent there? If you want to argue that the absence of patriarchy leads to more problems than its presence, I&rsquo;d expect a fairly detailed argument, book citation, or at least an acknowledgement that supporting such an assertion is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Kevin wrote elsewhere in the article that &ldquo;History is complex and rarely allows for meta-theories and monocausal explanations.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t blaming dysfunction and desperation on the absence of patriarchy a meta-theory with a monocausal explanation? Besides, I thought patriarchy was inevitable according to Kevin, so how can it be absent?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Kevin has a more robust model in his head, but I don&rsquo;t feel like he&rsquo;s inviting me into it; instead, I feel like he pulls out whatever bit supports his current point with no context to help me understand how the new argument avoids colliding with his previous argumentation.</p>
<h1 id="take-9-unsustainable-obedience">Take 9: Unsustainable Obedience?</h1>
<p>Underpinning Kevin&rsquo;s whole argument is an idea that a narrow complementarianism, focused around submission in the home and a male pastorate, isn&rsquo;t sustainable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my great concerns&hellip;is that complementarianism, for many Christians, amounts to little more than a couple of narrow conclusions about wives submitting to husbands in the home and ordination in the church being reserved for men. If that’s all we have in our vision for men and women, it’s not a vision we will hold on to for long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see him unpack this reasoning a bit more. Why won&rsquo;t we hold onto that vision for long? A basic argument in favor of sustainability could be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Christians are a people who pursue obedience to God &ndash; and make disciples who pursue obedience to God.</li>
<li>God commands men to lead in the homes as well as a male pastorate.</li>
<li>The textual exegesis of (2) is solid (i.e. egalitarians are clearly wrong).</li>
<li>Ergo, Christians can sustain this vision because we obey God and pass that obedience on to others.</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) and (3) are certainly disputed by egalitarians, but I don&rsquo;t expect much hostility from the complementarian side. (1) is certainly a mess from many perspectives, but if Christians can&rsquo;t do (1), they have a lot bigger problems than just the sustainability of complementarian thought; the whole Christian life, witness, and propagation of the faith comes into doubt. So (1) better be getting sorted out one way or the other.</p>
<p>I agree that it&rsquo;s nice when God gives explanations of why he commands what he does, but surely that is not necessary for Christian obedience? From what I know of the reformed tradition, it seems to heavily emphasize obedience first &ndash; often with uncertainties, doubts, or misgivings being attributed to faithlessness, rebellion, or hardness of heart. I don&rsquo;t recall ever seeing a reformed argument advocating for delaying obedience until God&rsquo;s command made sense.</p>
<p>So why does Kevin believe a narrow complementarian vision is unsustainable?</p>
<h1 id="take-10-the-less-charitable-view">Take 10: The Less Charitable View</h1>
<p>One idea I have &ndash; and I&rsquo;m not sure if it is charitably trying to make sense of the article or uncharitably impugning Kevin&rsquo;s motivations &ndash; is that there is a quiet, unwritten part anchoring Kevin&rsquo;s argument that I&rsquo;m supposed to &ldquo;just know.&rdquo; That is, if I just agreed with some fundamental premise (such as &ldquo;Of course, men are supposed to be in charge. How else could the world function?&rdquo;), then the rest of the argumentation would snap into place for me. I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the case, but if so, I wish Kevin would just say the quiet part out loud &ndash; it would make for a far stronger piece.</p>
<p>One other thought I have is whether a piece like this is for a really small audience who already take patriarchy as a given and want an authority to appeal to. The reason I ponder this thought is how haphazard the argumentation is, how little rationale is provided, and how unlikely it seems to accomplish its stated goals.</p>
<h1 id="finis">Finis</h1>
<p>Well, that was a long journey that I appreciate my readers taking with me (or perhaps undertaking a bit later if they&rsquo;ve jumped to the end to see the TLDR). I&rsquo;m left confused and baffled. My overall impression is that Kevin is advocating for the broadest definition of patriarchy that Barr offered &ndash; the one where society emphasizes male authority and female submission. I admit I&rsquo;m reading into Kevin&rsquo;s arguments there, but the references such as the ones to schools, anarchy, and all of life lead me to see this definition as the most plausible take on his thinking.</p>
<p>If Kevin or Desiring God is hiring a developmental editor, I&rsquo;m available and I have excellent rates. I know how to post ideas to Twitter so that smart people of the internet can review early renditions and help me steelman the argumentation. I even follow a <a href="https://twitter.com/bethallisonbarr">medieval historian</a> who might be willing to give a bit of her expert feedback if respectfully engaged.</p>
<p>Overall, my reaction is that if Kevin&rsquo;s rationale is representative of complementarian thought, I clearly should become an egalitarian. Conveniently, Kevin seems to agree with this, since he views something as patriarchy as non-negotiable for maintaining a complementarian vision. As a point of comparison, I&rsquo;d nudge readers toward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC">Mike Winger&rsquo;s recent teachings</a> on the role of women. While I haven&rsquo;t fully worked through all of them, I&rsquo;ve found the initial ones to be the sort of nuanced consideration I&rsquo;d expect from thoughtful engagement with the Bible, gender roles, and modern society.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I&rsquo;m concerned that Desiring God chose to publish this article and what that says about their editorial process. Any author can have a bad take &ndash; as an aspiring writer, I expect to have more than my fair share of misses and faux pas. But for this article to successfully navigate editorial review at Desiring God leaves me wondering what they believe intellectual rigor, accessible argumentation, and loving God with all our minds looks like.</p>
<p>On the plus side:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a much better sense of what Kevin has in mind when he talks about exegetical conclusions &ndash; a perspective that seems to embrace male authority across life and history far beyond what I understood the best hermeneutical principles to support.</li>
<li>I have some great questions when I run across people advocating for the CBMW or similar perspectives, such as &ldquo;What did you think of Kevin&rsquo;s article?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Have you publicly provided your own perspective on the patriarchy?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Kevin and I clearly have plenty to discuss if we should ever find ourselves eating lunch together.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, readers, that&rsquo;s my take on it as a musing villein. What say you? What did I miss? Where did I go too far? What else do I need to address for you to take this as a serious and reflective piece?</p>
<hr />
<p>&ndash; and patriarchy is the way that God made the world.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>But since Kevin doesn&rsquo;t actually say what he is advocating for, I&rsquo;m not sure if he agrees with the definition she and Bennett offer. Nor am I sure how much alteration the phrase &ldquo;something like&rdquo; is intended to express.</p>
<p>In fact, his whole article seems to accept the basic idea of</p>
<p>However, Kevin doesn&rsquo;t really attempt to tie the commands about wives submitting or pastors being men into a greater</p>
<p>Purpose 3: Rehabilitate and Promote the Patriarchy</p>
<p>Note: How does Kevin weave the narrative about how Men and women in patriarchy? Where does he lay the biblical foundation.
Note: How does this fit with the one-another commands?
Note: Is this piece a good &ldquo;size&rdquo; for an article? (Too many questions left, not enough explored)</p>
<p>So clearly my first take o</p>
<h3 id="purpose-2-holistic-complementarian-perspective">Purpose 2: Holistic Complementarian Perspective</h3>
<p>Or perhaps the purpose is defined when Kevin lays out the noble goal of having a holistic vision that exceeds just a few commands?</p>
<p>Fitting these commands into God&rsquo;s creative/redemptive plan is certainly a laudable intent.
At the moment, I would describe myself as a soft complementarian &ndash; I do believe that men should lead in the homes; I do believe that pastors should be men &ndash; but I&rsquo;m deeply concerned about the wrongs and harms created by such power structures, especially in America, especially in evangelical circles. Authors such as <a href="https://sheilawraygregoire.com/">Sheila Gregoire</a> raise some really compelling points and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Sex-Rescue-Recover-Intended/dp/1540900827">her research</a> into how popular &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; teachings impact women is&hellip;terrifying. In other words, when the application of Christian teachings creates such a gulf between theory (women are beloved daughters of God) and practice (women are being harmed and not protected), I have deep questions about why that gulf exists and how it should be rectified.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m absolutely interested in better connecting the complementarian commands to how they fit with the way the world is and how God made humanity. I should be a great audience for this.</p>
<p>The problem is that there seem to be very few serious, thoughtful soft complementiarian voices on the internet</p>
<p>The challenge is that there is a very vocal patriarchial</p>
<p>Beyond that, I find this perspective typical of the approach taken</p>
<p>If he was just some villein on the internet, I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Desiring God chose to publish his article.</p>

<h3 id="god-is-a-father">God Is A Father</h3>
<p>The argument: At its core, patriarchy is about father rule. Christians are not fundamentally opposed to father rule since we believe that God is a father who rules.</p>
<p>I flip-flopped on whether to include this point as an argument; I&rsquo;m not sure if Kevin intends it as an argument or merely as a rhetorical point to help defuse the baggage around the term <em>patriarchy</em>. In the end, I included it.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>For some, I expect this argument helps create openness to the idea of patriarchy. However, I find the argument very limited. Correctly translating God&rsquo;s position to human structures is tricky. For example, God is also a king, but I&rsquo;m wary about giving up the ideas of checks and balances in favor of a monarchy. God is a just judge, jury, prosecutor and defense attorney, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want a single human fulfilling all those roles in our justice system.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="patriarchy-is-anti-oppression">Patriarchy is Anti-Oppression</h3>
<p>The proposition: Kevin wants no part of domination, exploitation, or oppression.</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>Great; I applaud and commend Kevin&rsquo;s opposing these evils. I look forward to seeing why I might conclude that his vision of patriarchy lacks these features.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-past-was-better-maybe">The Past Was Better (Maybe)</h3>
<p>The argument: Life in medieval Europe[^old] was better for women and children than the popular conception. Patriarchy does not strictly equal oppression.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a musing villein, not a historian, so I won&rsquo;t presume to evaluate the historical claims here. However, historical comparisons of personal dynamics across many cultures between the far past and the present seem like they would be exceptionally difficult to do well.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="history-is-complex">History Is Complex</h3>
<p>The argument, in Kevin&rsquo;s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>History is complex and rarely allows for meta-theories and monocausal explanations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to argue that ignoring economic prosperity, it is debateable and perhaps unknowable whether or not women are happier now or in the past.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>This argument makes complete sense to me and what little I know of history. However, I also suspect it weakens the argument that old Europe is good evidence that patriarchy is not oppressive, or that we can derive decisive conclusions from such times.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="patriarchy-is-not-intrinsically-exploitative">Patriarchy Is Not Intrinsically Exploitative</h3>
<p>The argument: Sexual differentiation, subordination, and role distinctions are not, in and of themselves, evidence of exploitation.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>In a very strict conceptual sense, this appeal seems true. For example, a worker is subordinate<sup id="fnref:alt"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:alt">1</a></sup> to his boss, but I wouldn&rsquo;t assume the worker is exploited without more information. I&rsquo;m not sure how this argument will be moved from concept to practice, though.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="biased-opposition">Biased Opposition</h3>
<p>The proposition: Feminists (and perhaps others) have stacked the deck against patriarchy, biasing the discussion with terms such as subservience and inferiority.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>Perhaps this point is necessary to help some consider his arguments. I&rsquo;m sure that feminists and others would disagree vehemently with this characterization. I&rsquo;m inclined to grant the point for the sake of argument; if whether or not patriarchy&rsquo;s opponents are biased is the decisive factor in Kevin&rsquo;s argument, I&rsquo;ll come back and revisit it.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="complementarianism-hinges-on-patriarchy">Complementarianism Hinges On Patriarchy</h3>
<p>At this point, Kevin strongly asserts that complementarianism is reliant on patriarchy.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to call this an argument. I&rsquo;m not sure if Kevin intends it to be an argument for patriarchy, an assertion for what is at stake (and why complementarians should care), or evidence based on perceived common ground to help strengthen his rationale.</p>

<p>Reading the article, I sense Kevin intended this argument to be an emphatic reveal, setting the stage for the rest of his arguments. Instead, I find myself with questions: What do you mean by created order? In what ways can the created order not be understood? Since I believe that God made humanity male and female, why isn&rsquo;t Kevin&rsquo;s meaning here clearer to me/</p>
</div>
<h3 id="suitable-help-make-babies">Suitable Help: Make Babies</h3>
<p>The argument: The way in which woman is a suitable helper for Eve is that she can make babies. Otherwise, a group of male companions, a golden retriever, or a bunch of little Adams would have been equivalently good at solving the loneliness problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God could have created a group of male companions to hang out in Adam’s man cave so that Adam wouldn’t be alone. God could have given Adam a golden retriever or a gaggle of little Adams to keep him company&hellip;According to God’s biological design, only Eve (not another Adam) was a suitable helper because only Eve (together with Adam) could obey the creation mandate. That’s why she was “a helper fit for him” (Genesis 2:18).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>Wow, I don&rsquo;t know where to start here; I&rsquo;ll revisit this line of thought later in the series. For now, I&rsquo;ll just highlight how reductionistic this framing comes across as to me: Women&rsquo;s special distinctiveness is their ability to bear children. Maybe I&rsquo;m being uncharitable; maybe others will read it differently, but even if this argument was true, I&rsquo;d want to frame it very carefully if I wanted my opposition to hear me as caring about their personhood and well-being.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="men-and-women-are-different">Men and Women Are Different</h3>
<p>The argument: For lots of different reasons, we can see that men and women are different from birth &ndash; not as a result of nurture, not as a result of puberty, but largely because of creation.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m prepared to grant that men and women, in the aggregate, are different (e.g. most men, most of the time, are stronger than most women). I&rsquo;m not going to dive into the specifics Kevin offers here about how men and women differ. I&rsquo;m confident experts can far better unpack which differences are genetic, which ones are cultural, and so on. However, the fact that so many differences exist (according to Kevin) makes me question the argument that a woman&rsquo;s helpmate suitability hinges on her ability to bear children &ndash; are all of these differences <em>just</em> to support childbearing? Or did God have something further in mind in creating these differences?</p>
</div>
<h1 id="working-as-intended-or-oppression">Working as Intended - Or Oppression</h1>
<p>The argument: Either these differences reflect innate differences designed by God, or they reflect centuries of oppression. And Kevin hopes that Christians, believing in God&rsquo;s creation wisdom, will choose the former.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Reaction</p>
<p>This choice is one of several near absolute choices that Kevin offers. I&rsquo;ll touch more on that phenomena later in the series. For now, I&rsquo;m not clear I can&rsquo;t choose a mixture of both. To the extent that genetic differences exist, yes, I accept those are well-designed by a good God. But that doesn&rsquo;t say much about whether all differences in behavior or treatment can be traced back to genetics or God&rsquo;s design. (And then there&rsquo;s the whole field of epigenetics, which might link nurture back to nature in certain ways&hellip;)</p>
</div>
<h1 id="resistance-is-futile">Resistance Is Futile</h1>
<p>Kevin next references Steven Goldberg (author of <em>The Inevitability of Patriarchy</em> and <em>Why Men Rule</em>) to argue that, yes, the patriarchy is inevitable. As further evidence, he refutes the existence of matriarchies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matriarchies — societies where women have more political, economic and social power than men — do not exist; in fact, there is no evidence that they have ever existed</p>
