<p>So far in this series reflecting on Kevin’s DeYoung’s article “<a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/death-to-the-patriarchy">Death To the Patriarchy?</a>”, I’ve covered my take on his main point, his argumentation, and my big takeaways. In this article, I want to offer some more scattered reactions.</p>
<h1 id="appreciation">Appreciation</h1>
<p>I’ve clearly struggled to agree with much in Kevin’s approach or conclusions. But I want to commend Kevin on several points:</p>
<ol>
<li>I second his insight in seeing that complementarianism struggles to answer the “Why?” when reduced to commands about men leading in the home and male pastors. He is absolutely on target, and I wish more complementarians of all stripes would wrestle with that question.</li>
<li>I appreciate his choice to write on the topic, especially when not many do.</li>
<li>I’m glad he opposes all forms of domination, oppression, and exploitation.</li>
<li>In my own writings, I hope to emulate his boldness in laying out what must not be a very popular position. I wish far more Christians, especially pastors, would write so openly about what they believe.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="writing-helpmates">Writing Helpmates</h1>
<p>I consider myself as someone who ought to be pretty sympathetic to Kevin and his arguments. I’m complementarian, I grew up in conservative Christian circles (complete with implicit male leadership). I lean conservative on many topics (or at least conservative before conservative meant Team Trump). Philosophically, I accept the idea that distinctive roles do not necessitate greater and less dignity. And yet I find Kevin’s flow of thought hard to understand or just absent. And not missing in a “I know I’m leaving a gap; go see such-n-such to fill it in” or a “I’d love to unpack this assertion in the future” way. If I’m struggling, I assume those farther to the left will be far less inclined to take this piece seriously.</p>
<p>Given my previous discussion about Kevin’s and Desiring God’s stated audience, two suggestions follow.</p>
<h2 id="hire-a-developmental-editor">Hire A Developmental Editor</h2>
<p>Get an editor to help organize the flow of thought and refine the argumentation. If the goal is, as stated, to promote something like the patriarchy, there are better ways of structuring and presenting the argument. This role isn’t about punctuation or grammar, it’s about whether thoughts and ideas are cohesive, well-argued, and make sense.</p>
<p>For Desiring God, that editor needs to have control over what gets published. I don’t know what their process is, but the fact that this article made it through suggests to me that they don’t have developmental editors who can say “This article isn’t ready yet; it needs more work.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’d suggest that the ideal editor is a woman who is at least a soft complementarian if not an egalitarian. <em>I’m uncertain, though, if giving a woman such editorial discretion might violate Kevin’s conscience regarding the proper role of women, so I suppose a thoughtful man who knows how to talk to women could suffice.</em></p>
<h2 id="user-experience-testing">User Experience Testing</h2>
<p>I’ve long appreciated the humorous  “<a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html">Top 100 Things I’d Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord</a>.” One of them is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, test out your writing on those who disagree with you. There were a number of thoughtful replies such as <a href="https://twitter.com/j_rhett/status/1552402079725096960">this one</a> not long after this article went up. If you don’t have any other way to do <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/user-experience-testing/">user experience testing</a>, take advantage of these people to improve the article. While attempting to rehabilitate the patriarchy is sure to draw fire, surely steelmanning the arguments would go a long way to make people seriously consider the benefits of “something like the patriarchy.”</p>
<h1 id="baby-factory-aka-helpmate">Baby Factory AKA Helpmate</h1>
<p>When summarizing Kevin’s article, I said one of his points was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A woman is a suitable helper for man (only) because she can bear children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, if I’m reading Kevin correctly, he says that women are good helpmates because – and only because – they can have babies. First, he suggests that there were many solutions to the problem of aloneness, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God could have created a group of male companions to hang out in Adam’s man cave so that Adam wouldn’t be alone. God could have given Adam a golden retriever or a gaggle of little Adams to keep him company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to define why Eve was a good helpmate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to God’s biological design, only Eve (not another Adam) was a suitable helper because only Eve (together with Adam) could obey the creation mandate. That’s why she was “a helper fit for him” (Genesis 2:18).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that’s an interpretation of Genesis 2:18. I wish a good editor had helped Kevin here; I’m not sure if I’m misreading him as reducing a woman’s distinctiveness as a marital helpmate down to “she can have babies” – but that’s sure how he reads to me. I know that there are lines of Christian thought that emphasize the obligation of married couples to have children or the unreasonableness of marrying if one does not want children. But this take seems to go a lot further than that. I’d love to see a link to a cohesive exegesis of that passage. From my reading of the text, I’d be hard-pressed to draw the same conclusion, certainly in such an authoritative way.</p>
<p>In fact, this interpretation seems highly suspect given the mountain of evidence that Kevin points to elsewhere for deep differences between men and women: All of these innate differences exist, but the only difference that contributes to Eve being a suitable helper for Eve is her ability to bear children?</p>
<p>I expect this line of thinking to hit infertile women and others struggling with having children particularly hard. Because the implication is that, if one can’t have children, one isn’t a suitable helpmate.</p>
<p>The implications for same-sex couples are also a bit surprising: If a same-sex couple can adopt children, is a man really as good a companion for a man as a woman? Or is a same-sex couple as good companionship for each other as an infertile couple? Kevin’s answer here seems to be yes. I’m all for following the Biblical text where it takes us, but Kevin’s take here seems to unnecessarily cede an immense amount of ground to the same-sex marriage crowd that I expect he (and others) would like to defend.</p>
<h1 id="dichotomous-choices">Dichotomous Choices</h1>
<p>A final thought for today: Kevin’s article has a pattern where he offers choices between extremes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embrace a patriarchal-like worldview or choose godless modern egalitarian chaos.</li>
<li>Accept gender differences as genetic or defend them all being rooted in centuries of oppression. (And don’t get me started about the field of epigenetics.)</li>
<li>Adopt patriarchy or accept the inevitable abandonment of faithful obedience to the clear commands of God.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not clear why my options are so extreme. Can I not be concerned about unbridled capitalism without being a communist or socialist? Can I not have my doubts about mob rule and pure democracy without endorsing dictatorships and divine rule? Can I not have deep concerns about systems that seem to give certain men vast amounts of power – largely checked by Twitter and public outrage – without promoting anarchy or abandoning Biblical principles? Can’t I believe that men and women are different and also accept that the institutions of men often systematically dehumanize women and effectively deny they are precious children of God?</p>
<p>Alright, that’s it for today. As always, comments are welcome.</p>
