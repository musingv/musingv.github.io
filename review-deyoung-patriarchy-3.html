<p>So far in this series reflecting on Kevin’s DeYoung’s article “<a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/death-to-the-patriarchy">Death To the Patriarchy?</a>”, I’ve covered my take on his main point, his argumentation, and an initial reaction about how he comes across to his audience and why it matters.</p>
<p>Today I want to cover the remainder of my big reactions – and then in future articles, we’ll dive into a couple particular arguments and smaller takes.</p>
<h1 id="irrational-arguments">Irrational Arguments</h1>
<p>At its core, the article is not an intellectual argument, nor does it appear to understand why it is not a rational argument.</p>
<p>Three examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Midway through the article, Kevin introduces this idea that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, patriarchy is inevitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that furthermore,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matriarchies — societies where women have more political, economic and social power than men — do not exist; in fact, there is no evidence that they have ever existed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet if the patriarchy is inevitable, why spill so much ink on the subject in this fashion? Would it not be more helpful and winsome to write a passionate appeal to egalitarians and feminists to stop beating their heads against a brick wall for their own sake?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kevin carefully introduces the idea that Old Europe provides (presumably compelling) evidence that patriarchy is not the same as oppression. He argues that women were honored and children were loved. And then he goes on to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>History is complex and rarely allows for meta-theories and monocausal explanations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is entirely debatable (and, perhaps, ultimately unknowable) whether women are happier in the present than they were in the past</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if Old Europe was less oppressive under a patriarchy (and I’m not enough of a historian to comment on that), then are not the causes for that reality more complex than simply the existence of patriarchy? I agree with Kevin that history is complex and rarely monocausal, but he completely undermines his own evidence here.</p>
<p>Likewise, I agree with him it is difficult to compare the happiness of past people and present people across time and space – differing circumstances, expectations,  individuals, and so on – but that’s not helping the argument for patriarchy much, especially since I think most women are far more concerned with how they and their recent ancestors have been treated, not the happiness of their ancestors hundreds of years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kevin goes on to claim the lack of father rule always leads to less desirable outcomes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What school or church or city center or rural hamlet is better off when fathers no longer rule? Where communities of women and children can no longer depend upon men to protect and provide, the result is not freedom and independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While that’s certainly a claim – or at least a complicated question – but does it really hold up under any level of scrutiny? Questions that leap to mind…</p>
<ol>
<li>How is Kevin defining <em>better off</em>? And the term <em>rule</em>?</li>
<li>Is Kevin suggesting that any father is better running any institution than any women? That seems like a huge stretch without more justification.</li>
<li>Is Kevin suggesting that patriarchy applies to every institution? If not, which ones does he have in mind? The reference to schools and city centers suggests to me a very expansive view of the male authority, which should make counter-examples easier to find<sup id="fnref:divorce"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:divorce">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Does he mean “fathers and only fathers rule” or does he mean “wise men and women rule together”? I’m guessing the former, but maybe he’s really concerned about the possibility that fathers are completely excluded from leadership.</li>
<li>Is Kevin suggesting that churches should only have pastors who are fathers – no more single or childless pastors? That’s an interesting concept to explore, but I suspect that’s not at all what Kevin means to promote.</li>
</ol>
<p>And beyond all of those questions, what ever happened to the inevitability of patriarchy? If it is inevitable, then how are there so many examples of absent fathers to prove how important patriarchy is? And since history is complex and non-monocausal, even if there were such examples, wouldn’t patriarchy, at best, be a factor in the problems?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if one were to largely grant the large majority of Kevin’s points such as the differences of men and women and a strong bias against patriarchy, that’s not enough to establish the goodness of patriarchy if there is good evidence it contributes to massive harms. Which brings me to…</p>
<h1 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The Elephant In The Room</h1>
<p>I find the most powerful (Christian) argument against patriarchy to be a long-standing, wide-spread, and documented harm to women. The witnesses inlcude enough who purport to be sisters in Christ that their testimony cannot be easily dismissed<sup id="fnref:resurrection"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:resurrection">1</a></sup>. That is, it isn’t the philosophical debate of whether or not a woman has equal value if a man leads her in marriage. Instead, it’s a restatement of the classic problem of evil, which goes like this: If God is all good and all powerful, then how does evil exist?</p>
<p>A similar objection exists when promoting the patriarchy or something like it. If patriarchy is so good, then what do we do with the evil that comes with it? I see five basic complementarian responses:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tactical denial</strong>: There really isn’t a large scale abuse of power, so we don’t need to worry about it. All of these stories of women (and men) being mistreated while the system protects their abusers are rare exceptions; overall, men are doing great with power.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical delay</strong>: The abuse matters and is a big deal, but it isn’t the right time to tackle the problem; there are more pressing concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Moral imperative</strong>: We can’t do better and still obey God. The evil is regrettable, but it’s just the inevitable outcome of following God the way he wants to be followed.</li>
<li><strong>Moral justification</strong>: The abuse of power isn’t that big of a deal. The important thing (e.g. the gospel, name of Jesus, whatever) is happening. Those mistreated by power should suck it up and appreciate their role in promoting the glory of God.</li>
<li><strong>Reform</strong>: Yes, what is happening is a great evil; how can such a thing happen among the people of God? We must repent and do better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of these is Kevin’s answer? Or does he have another response? I sense no remorse or concern in his tone or perspective. (See, for example, his calls to recovering the past along with some of <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/reparations-a-critical-theological-review/">other</a> <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/toward-a-better-discussion-about-abuse/">writings</a>). So responses (2), (3), and (5) seem straight out the window.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Context</p>
<p>Here is a small sampling of the kind of evil that seems to be unaddressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decades of shuffling abusers around in the Southern Baptist convention while denouncing the integrity of the abused. See for example, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23131530/southern-baptist-convention-sexual-abuse-scandal-guidepost">Southern Baptist report</a>.</li>
<li>Sheila Gregoire’s 22,000 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Sex-Rescue-Recover-Intended/dp/1540900827">woman study</a> on the harms of evangelical teaching.</li>
<li>The long-term support and acceptance of pastors such as Mark Driscoll (Mars Hill), James MacDonald (Harvest Bible Church), Steve Timmis (Acts 29, the Crowded House), and Bill Hybels (Willow Creek). In many cases, their behavior was known (or should have been known) in inner circles and sometimes continued even after public exposure.</li>
<li>The high rates of pornography use among Christians. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKa47d5PD-k">Sheila’s research</a>, for example, suggests 50% of Christian men use pornography.</li>
<li>Voices such as <a href="https://jemartisby.com/">Jemar Tisby</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleJamesHoward">Kyle Howard</a> arguing that white evangelical America has a real problem with racism.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The charitable view, then, is (1) – Kevin doesn’t think there is a significant problem in how women are treated in American culture, either now or in the recent past. If he’s right, that certainly strengthens the case for patriarchy. I’d love to see Kevin actually talk about what evidence it would take to convince him that patriarchy has a major issue in how it treats women. If Sheila’s research of how evangelical teachings have impacted 22,000 women doesn’t do it, what would do it? Or is the belief that patriarchy must be good, regardless of evidence, an article of faith rather than a matter of evidence?</p>
<p>I applaud Kevin’s explicit disavowal of domination, exploitation, and oppression. But he seems unwilling to acknowledge any connection – however tenuous – between patriarchy and such harms. I’d love to see him react to the stories of different women who have been harmed, do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis">root cause analysis</a> on what led to those harms, and finally propose changes to avoid those harms in the future.</p>
<p>My sense is there is a disconnect here. Maybe it is he doesn’t think patriarchy is the root issue. Maybe he doesn’t think the harms should be categorized as domination, exploitation, or oppression. Maybe he doesn’t think the harms are real, or that bad. I don’t know. But something feels off between his disavowal of harms and his enthusiastic embrace of fathers ruling. Maybe the way we’re handling power in the American evangelical circles is fine – but there seems to be a lot of evidence and voices saying we have a problem. And I’m not clear how in good conscience I can ignore the testimony of so many (including many professing to be brothers and sisters who follow Jesus) and just chalk it up to all these objectors being completely blind and/or rebellious. Or perhaps all these voices are beyond the spirit of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A27">James’ command</a> to care for orphans and widows in their distress?</p>
<h1 id="understanding-gods-word">Understanding God’s Word</h1>
<p>My third big question about Kevin’s article is its connection to God’s word. He talks about how we need a worldview that aligns with the best hermeneutical practices. What I’m unclear on is how much of this article he believes is based on correct interpretation of God’s word, and how much is, at best, an understanding of natural revelation. I see two basic options for Kevin’s view:</p>
<ol>
<li>A small set of commands are God’s revelation in the Bible (e.g. women submitting in the home, male pastors) and the rest of what Kevin writes is his understanding of natural revelation.</li>
<li>All – or almost all – of Kevin’s theology is revealed in the Bible, but he’s using the world around him to persuade others.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will dismiss option (2) almost out of hand. It doesn’t seem to fit Kevin’s argumentation, and I’m not aware of any serious consistent hermeneutical approach to understanding the Bible that would result in Kevin’s conclusions while remaining a reformed evangelical perspective. If my commentators highlight an option I haven’t considered here, I’ll re-evaluate.</p>
<p>(1) isn’t much less problematic. Kevin appears to be attempting to establish an authoritative, cross-cultural principle of male rule based on his understanding of natural revelation and a handful of Biblical commands. Or as he puts it, for “in all of life and in all of history.” There appears to be no other possible understanding that is faithful to the Bible; no possibility he is misunderstanding natural revelation; no hesitation. Kevin’s approach seems as authoritative as when he writes about God’s explicit revelation in his word.</p>
<p>I understand Kevin may not want to take the space to rehash Biblical interpretation in this article. But when being presented with such a sweeping and authoritative claim, I expect to at least be pointed elsewhere to what he views as the best argumentation and Biblical support for his position. And the writings I’ve seen by complementarians (such as the CBMW) simply do not come close to establishing the sort of Biblical arguments needed, even granting positions such as the primacy of Adam, the headship of the husband, and a male pastorate.</p>
